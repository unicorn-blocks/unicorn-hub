## **How does Unicorn protect children’s privacy?**  
Children’s privacy is extremely important to us. All audio data from our interactions is deleted, and only necessary text data is securely stored with parental consent (if you prefer not to store data, that’s fine too—kids and I will still have a great time). Think of it as keeping our secrets safe, with a promise to protect privacy every step of the way!  

## **What is Unicorn’s vision?**  
We are a group of people who grew up with unlimited childhood fantasies but were often told, “Toys aren’t REAL.” As we grew older, we accepted this “reality.” However, working in the tech industry, we’ve seen how quickly technology is advancing and realized that childhood dreams could become a reality. At Unicorn, we’ve seen enough disappointment from kids worldwide and are determined to ensure no child has to face the idea that “toys aren’t real” ever again.  

## **How does Unicorn plan to achieve this vision?**  
After coming up with this idea in September, we spoke to around 50 kids to understand how they like to play with their toys. Based on their feedback, we developed a prototype and formed a strategic partnership with a reputable building block company with over 35 years of history. Currently, we are fundraising to manufacture our product and bring this fantasy dream to children worldwide.  

## **Who is behind Unicorn?**  
We are a team of individuals working in high-tech firms, with educational backgrounds from prestigious institutions like the University of Pennsylvania, Purdue University, and the University of Michigan. Our mission is to combine cutting-edge technology with toys to bring children’s dreams to life.
